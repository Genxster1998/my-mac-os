# Ayu Mirage theme for iTerm

You can install the theme from [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/master/iterm/Ayu%20Mirage.itermcolors) and open it in iTerm to install the theme. Here is how it looks:

It goes really well with [Ayu Mirage theme for Vim](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-vim).
