# Ayu Mirage theme for iTerm
I love using [Ayu](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu) theme across all my editors. I couldn't find this theme for iTerm though so I made it.

You can install the theme from [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/048bc8ab/iterm/Ayu%20Mirage.itermcolors) and open it in iTerm to install the theme. Here is how it looks:

It goes well with [Pure Zsh theme](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) and [Ayu theme for Vim](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-vim).
