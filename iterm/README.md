# Monokai Octagon theme for iTerm
I love using [Monokai Octagon](https://www.monokai.pro/vscode/) theme across all my editors. I couldn't find this theme for iTerm though so I made it.

You can install the theme from [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/master/iterm/Monokai%20Octagon.itermcolors) and open it in iTerm. Here is how it looks:

It goes well with [Pure Zsh theme](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) and [Ayu theme for Vim](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-vim).
