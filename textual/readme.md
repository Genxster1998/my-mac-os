# Ayu theme for Textual
I love IRC and hanging out in various Freenode channels. I also love [ayu theme](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu).

I wasn't happy with any of the default themes Textual comes with so I made this theme. Here is how it looks:

It is essentially modfied [TotalSublime](https://github.com/danieldbird/total-sublime) theme. I only changed the colours to match the look of Ayu theme.

I am using `Monotype Sorts` font.

## Install
To install the theme, download the Ayu folder attached [here](Ayu).

Then go to Textual app. Go to preferences and in Styles click on `Browse Styles` here:

Put the downloaded folder inside the folder. You can read [this](https://help.codeux.com/textual/Styles.kb) for more information.
