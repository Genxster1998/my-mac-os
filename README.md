## Applications
I use a lot of applications on my mac. Below is a list of the ones that I love and use the most in my day to day life, sorted by their importance.

I also share [my dotfiles](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles) and I made a [Telegram group](https://t.me/macOSautomation) to discuss all things macOS/iOS.

### 1. [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) - Launcher
- Alfred is a very powerful launcher that you can program to show you anything you want. It saved me a lot of time in my life.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kbw0yCF.png" width="600" alt="img">

- It has a great [community](http://www.alfredforum.com/) and very powerful [workflows](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows#readme) that you can use.

- I wrote [an article](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/writing-alfred-workflows-in-go-2a44f62dc432) on how anyone can start developing workflows of their own using Go language and [AwGo](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo) library.

### 2. [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) - Keyboard remapping
- Karabiner is an absolutely amazing app that lets you remap keys at a very low level on macOS.
- I have completely remapped my keyboard with it and every key on my keyboard is a custom modifier key that I can program to do what I want.
- For example you can make caps lock into an escape key when pressed once but if you hold it, it becomes a [hyper key](http://brettterpstra.com/2017/06/15/a-hyper-key-with-karabiner-elements-full-instructions/). Hyper key means that a key now serves two purposes, once when pressed alone and once when held down. So for example for remapping caps lock, we can remap it to act as escape when pressed alone once but if we hold down on it it becomes âŒ˜ + âŒƒ modifier key. So `caps lock + F` becomes âŒ˜ + âŒƒ + F. And so on.
- I take this idea further and define these kind of hyper keys for __every single key on my keyboard__.
- My Karabiner config can be seen [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/karabiner/private.xml) and is described [here](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.html).

### 3. [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) - Automation tool
- Keyboard Maestro is essentially an IDE for automation. You create macros of actions that you can then easily call from Karabiner.
- It has a [wonderful community](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/) that is happy to help with whatever you are trying to achieve.
- I share [all the macros I use](km-macros#readme) with the app.

### 4. [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) - Code editor
- My favourite editor that I use to write code in. Most notably I like its [Vim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) and [Go](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go) plugins.
- My config for it can be found [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/vscode/settings.json).
- I also love using [Ayu One Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=faceair.ayu-one-dark) theme with [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font. Here is how it looks:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/q44Or5z.png" width="500" alt="img">

### 5. [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) - Terminal Emulator
- Moved completely to using the command line for all my development needs. I go over how I use the app [here](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/iterm.html).
- [Here](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/3fbe13ce427132d0297f411b62f49034) are all the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/index.html) packages I like and use.
- I also love using [this workflow](https://github.com/isometry/alfred-tty) to quickly switch between iTerm tabs.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/RNLb5wj.png" width="500" alt="img">

### 6. [2Do](http://www.2doapp.com/mac) - Flexible task manager
- I love GTD methodology, this application is phenomenal with helping me [organise my tasks and things](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/2do.html) I want to do and achieve. Here is how my sidebar looks:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0yUToEK.png" width="150">

- And it has global quick add with a hotkey. Together with lists, priorities, powerful search and a lot more.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UPdjh6N.png" width="400" alt="img">

### 7. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) - Text Editor
- Use this editor in addition to VS Code and Neovim for its blazing fast speed of opening files.
- I use it primarily to edit markdown files like [my wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/other/wiki-workflow.html). I also edit config files and open large and small files for quick edits.
- [Six](https://github.com/guillermooo/Six) vim plugin for this editor is genuinely amazing. Alongside [Ayu theme](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu).

### 8. [Trello](https://trello.com) - Project management tool
- I use the app a lot to track various ongoing things I have in my life.
- I share many boards I made [publically](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-trello.html). Here is an example of a public board for tracking various [things I want to learn](https://trello.com/b/cu32qF3q).
![](https://i.imgur.com/YHmPwsx.jpg)

- I nearly always use two labels: __Important__ and __Next__. And I mark the cards I am working on and set deadlines on most cards.

### 9. [1Password](https://1password.com) - Password manager
- Generate all of my passwords with it and keep everything in a secured and encrypted vault kept secure by my one master password.
- No longer need to remember passwords and I now have a unique password for every website that I am signed up on whilist activating two factor authentication wherever possible.

### 10. [MindNode](https://mindnode.com) - Interactive Mind Mapping
- An application which allowed me to originally create all of the maps for [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz).
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/master/media/header.png" width="700" alt="img">

- It is an incredible joy to make mind maps in this app and I use it to visualize everything. [My Notes, projects, plans and thoughts](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/mind-map-everything-d27670f70739#.p7w44kr44).
- I also try to completely bridge the gap between [my mind maps](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-mind.html) and my mind with [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind).
- In short, MindNode for me is the ultimate playground where ideas get born and played with first. I even have a __thinking__ map that I open with Karabiner by pressing `f + :`. And I [brainstorm things](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/research/solving-problems.html) I am doing __now__ there. Here is how that looks:

![](https://i.imgur.com/uYr28eZ.png)

### 11. [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) - API Documentation Browser
- Allows you to download any docset that you might want to use, search for any method, class or anything that you need very quickly, comes with the amazing [Alfred Worfklow](https://www.alfredapp.com/blog/productivity/dash-quicker-api-documentation-search/) to simplify the process of searching for the right things.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/tBEkKtL.png" width="500" alt="img">

- I also use [this workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/tree/master/dash-profile-switch#readme) I made to quickly switch between Dash profiles.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wyqtfCM.png" width="500" alt="img">

### 12. [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/) - IRC Client
- I love IRC and this is the best macOS client for it.
- I created my own custom [Ayu theme](textual#readme) that I love.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5SglNCi.png" width="500" alt="img">

- The app also has an awesome channel search feature that I use a lot.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jwVCcMb.png" width="500" alt="img">

### 13. [Telegram](https://desktop.telegram.org/) - Messenger
- The app has a very clean interface, a native client for macOS and stickers. Chats are not encrypted by default and don't use [approved cryptography](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/49782/is-telegram-secure) but the client is really amazing and fast.

### 14. [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/) - Snippet manager
- I use the app to manage my own personal library of snippets. I prefix all snippets I make. For example vim snippets are prefixed with `vim:`. Git related snippets with `git:` and so on.
- This lets me then use the [Alfred workflow](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/press-release/whats-new/osx-1.6.html) that the App's author provides to search for these snippets insanely fast.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gzoH1Dh.png" width="500" alt="img">

Here is how my library looks:
![](https://i.imgur.com/cDmCSyE.png)

- I share my entire library of snippets you can import yourself [here](snippetslab#readme).

### 15. [Timing](https://timingapp.com/whats-new) - Automatic time tracker
- I use Timing app to fully automate tracking my time on my computer.
- The fact that I can combine active and passive tracking together is very powerful and allows me to be more aware of where I spend my time.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/U6wxKLn.png" width="500" alt="img">

### 16. [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) - Digital journal
- Day One is my digital life journal.
- My entire life's experiences lives encrypted in the journal. Adding photographs I made, the thoughts I had and events that happened to me.
- I document and review [my life](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/looking-back/looking-back.html) publicly too.
- The app has integration with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/day_one) which I use to automatically log all [my tweets](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev) and [Insgragram posts](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/).
- If you don't journal, I suggest you to start, it is a very powerful mind cleanser and acts as a wonderful history record of your life.

### 17. [Ulysses](http://www.ulyssesapp.com/) - Writing app
- The app I use to write all my [Medium](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) articles in. As well as writing notes for different [books I read](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/books/books.html).
- All your writing in one place is the motto and the underlying design of the app. I hook up my [wiki](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) as an external folder and I love how it creates an index of everything that I can search over:
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Aa17RCQ.png" width="500" alt="img">

- It also has pretty awesome export functions that let you export the text you write to PDF, ePub and HTML. I mostly use it's ability to export text to Medium.

### 19. [Pixave](http://www.littlehj.com/mac) - Image/GIF/Video organizer

### 20. [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net/) - Mac input customizer
- I use this app a lot for mapping [various trackpad gestures](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/take-control-of-your-touchpad-on-macos-45c581f542e0#.7n1ye6vze) to hotkeys and actions both globally and per specific application.

- By far the most well designed and feature rich mail application that I have used so far. Has simple design, support for multiple accounts and a multitude of nice shortcuts that you can use.
- I approach all of my email tasks in GTD style. Keeping my email inbox close to 0 at all times.

### 23. [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) - Music streaming
- Found a [lot of great music](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev) with this application and the phenomenal [Alfred Workflow](http://alfred-spotify-mini-player.com/) makes using the application an absolute joy.
- Quickly finding artists, songs I want to listen, instantly adding the song playing to my [Likes](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev/playlist/0ERn0U4qZIKC8Dy7RrMMsn?) playlist or any other playlist I want, seeing what other songs the artist has and more.

### 21. [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) - Calendar
- I use the app to manage events in my life.
- I take great use of Fantastical's natural language input and I use [many Typinator expansions](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/fantastical-natural-input-text-expansions-3ea8cf7ccac3#.pv5937ncr) to ease this process.
- I always view my events from `Week` view. And show 5 days only with all 24h shown for all days. This lets me have a perspective over what I have to do now. What deadlines I have to complete soon. And gives my the freedom to adjust my schedule in light of upcoming deadlines and events.

### 22. [Contexts](https://contexts.co) - Window switcher
- Allows me to fuzzy search through all the currenly active windows that I have.

- It is incredibly fast to make the searches and it gives quick autosuggestions for any query I type that I can then select with up and down arrows.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/BPOmjkZ.png" width="500" alt="img">

### 22. [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) - Menu bar organizer
- A great utility app that allows you to customise and hide the contents of your menu bar and improve the aesthetics of your OS. It is also is quite beneficial for me as I customised it to have the most important information that I need to show in it.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/E0ODZBv.png" width="500" alt="img">

- I use the app to stay up to date and communicate on Twitter.
- Tweetbot is also blocked for me during my `Focus` time. I can only post tweets but I can't visit the app to see my feeds.
- Twitter is my primary way to stay up to date on things and is my favourite social network after GitHub. I curate and publically share all [Twitter lists](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists) I personally use.
- I have Tweetbot open in full screen with four columns (Mentions/[Top](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/top1)/[ML](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/ml)/[Other](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/other1)). Here is how that looks for me:

### 31. [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/) - BitTorrent client

- Another great utility I cannot live without, brings up a quick menu whenever some text is selected on which I can do a number of quick actions, like searching on Google, DuckDuckGo, Youtube, Dictionary, Reddit, Google Images or it can translate text selected, copy it or even make a SnippetsLab snippet from it.

	- This allows me to write some great rules for my Downloads folder that will file the files where I want them to be.
	- Here is one example of such rule:

## Browsers
### [Safari](https://www.apple.com/lae/safari/)
- My favourite browser for many reasons. It is incredibly fast, doesn't have the baggage of all the Google Chrome tracking and is native to macOS so it is extremely optimised and doesn't kill your battery.
- One powerful plus that Chrome does have over safari is the amount of chrome extensions that you can get. Fortunately the ones most needed for me do [exist on Safari](https://github.com/learn-anything/safari-extensions#readme).

### [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- I only use Chrome for web devolopment due to its superior Chrome Dev tools.
- I also really love the variety of [Chrome extensions](https://github.com/learn-anything/chrome-extensions#readme) that people have built and shared.

### [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com)
- Experimental Peer to Peer browser. Experimenting with using it more and more as I find the technology and the implications of it fascinating.

### [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)
- Use it for web devolopment for its superior Dev Tools in debugging CSS Grid. Prefer Chrome dev tools still.

## Command Line Apps
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a wonderful and user friendly package manager for macOS. I am however trying to move and use [nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) package manager instead.
